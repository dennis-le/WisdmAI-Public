As for your question, the current Amazon stock price of $94.18 is below my breakeven point of $101.66, so I would not recommend exercising your option at this time. However, given the overall positive trend in the stock market lately, it's possible that Amazon's share price could rise above my breakeven point in the future and at that point it might make sense to exercise your option and sell shares of Amazon stock at a profit.

205,QQQ,stocks,Downsides of TQQQ/SPXL,"It’s a pure math thing… TQQQ gives you a 3x return *daily… that means if you have a string of green days, it compounds incredibly well, such as in a bull market in 2021. The catch is that a string of red days compounds negatively 3x, and for mathematical reasons, that puts you in the hole much faster than the green days hold you up (kinda same idea as how losing 50% means you have to earn 200% just to get back to the same spot).

In other words, in a bear market or downtrend periods where you’ll have more down days than up days, you get much worse performance.. that’s why it’s down 75% ytd whereas normal QQQ is only down 29% ytd. Conversely, during last yr’s historic bull bubble, it exploded much higher, given the greater amount of green days than red.. there’s a bit more nuance to it than that but that’s the general gist.",8,2,False,394,True,2022-11-22

208,QQQ,stocks,Downsides of TQQQ/SPXL,"The levered and daily rebalancing nature of these makes them drift off simply returning 3x the underlying.

I’m traveling and not set up to do the math, but imagine the underlying does this over 5 days.

100, 95, 100, 100, 95

Well, I’m the first day, you’re going to drop from 100 to 85. Three times the daily 5% drop. Now, the next day, when the underlying rises from 95 back to 100, that’s a 5.26% increase, so they leveraged funds is going to move 15.79% (there’s some trailing digits). 85 increased by 15.79% is 98.42.

In this case, the underlying is even after 2 days, but the leveraged fund is still down 1.58%. 

Now, in a long, relatively smooth period like most of the last decade, the leveraged fund can kill. But in volatile times, it’s possible to lose money despite the underlying increasing.

> Next year, other car brands will catch up Tesla EV globally - VW, Merc, BMW - you name it and they are more than ready to sacrifice short term gain to get market share.

People have been saying this for 5+ years, and every year it's not true. And we don't even need to wait for next year to know it's not true, because neither VW, Merc nor BMW have even announced plans to sell anywhere near the amount of EVs that would allow them to compete with Tesla, never mind actually executing on it.

BYD is indeed an actual competitor to Tesla in China, and eventually perhaps will eventually even become a competitor in the West. Saying that any of the German brands will be a competitor next year is just disingenuous though.

My best guess would be Q4 earnings report, as analysts are expecting $1.26 in EPS, and it will likely be more in the $1.3-1.4 range. But even if it doesn't happen then, TSLA is on track to have a PEG ratio in the sub-0.3s by 2025, while 1.5-3 is the norm for large caps. It will at least 3x in the next three years, possibly more.
